        GCODE Parser for Python
        
        Currently in development, ``pygcode`` is a low-level GCode interpreter
        for python.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Using `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydemia>`__:
        
        ``pip install pygcode``
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Just brainstorming here...
        
        Writing GCode
        -------------
        
        Writing gcode from python object instances to text
        
        ::
        
            >>> from pygcode import *
            >>> gcodes = [
            ...     GCodeRapidMove(Z=5),
            ...     GCodeStartSpindleCW(),
            ...     GCodeRapidMove(X=10, Y=20),
            ...     GCodeFeedRate(200),
            ...     GCodeLinearMove(Z=-1.5),
            ...     GCodeRapidMove(Z=5),
            ...     GCodeStopSpindle(),
            ... ]
            >>> print('\n'.join(str(g) for g in gcodes))
        
            G00 Z5
            M03
            G00 X10 Y20
            F200
            G01 Z-1.5
            G00 Z5
            M05
        
        
        To plot along a lines of vectors, you could write...
        
        ::
        
            >>> from pygcode import *
            >>> from euclid import Vector3
        
            >>> vectors = [
            ...     Vector3(0, 0, 0),
            ...     Vector3(10, 0, 0),
            ...     Vector3(10, 20, 0),
            ...     Vector3(10, 20, 3),
            ...     Vector3(0, 20, 3),
            ...     Vector3(0, 0, 3),
            ...     Vector3(0, 0, 0)
            ... ]
        
            >>> to_coords = lambda v: {'X': v.x, 'Y': v.y, 'Z': v.z}
            >>> for v in vectors:
            ...     print("%s" % GCodeLinearMove(**to_coords(v)))
        
            G01 X0 Y0 Z0
            G01 X10 Y0 Z0
            G01 X10 Y20 Z0
            G01 X10 Y20 Z3
            G01 X0 Y20 Z3
            G01 X0 Y0 Z3
            G01 X0 Y0 Z0
        
        
        Reading / Interpreting GCode
        ----------------------------
        
        To read gcode from a file, utilise the ``Line`` class.
        Each ``Line`` instance contains a ``Block`` and an optional ``Comment``.
        The ``Block`` contains a list of gcodes you're after.
        
        ::
        
            from pygcode import Line
        
            with open('part.gcode', 'r') as fh:
                for line_text in fh.readlines():
                    line = Line(line_text)
        
                    print(line)  # will print the line (with cosmetic changes)
                    line.block.gcodes  # is your list of gcodes
                    line.block.modal_params  # are all parameters not assigned to a gcode, assumed to be motion modal parameters
                    if line.comment:
                        line.comment.text  # your comment text
        
        To elaborate, here are some line examples
        
        ::
        
            >>> from pygcode import Line
        
            >>> line = Line('G01 x1 y2  f100 s1000 ; blah')
            >>> print(line)
            G01 X1 Y2 F100 S1000 ; blah
            >>> print(line.block)
            G01 X1 Y2 F100 S1000
            >>> print(line.comment)
            ; blah
        
            >>> line = Line('G0 x1 y2 (foo) f100 (bar) s1000')
            >>> print(line)
            G00 X1 Y2 F100 S1000 (foo. bar)
            >>> print(line.comment)
            (foo. bar)
        
        
        Interpreting what a line of gcode does depends on the machine it's running on,
        and also that machine's state (or 'mode')
        
        The simple line of a rapid move to ``x=10, y=10`` may be ``G00 X10 Y10``.
        However, if the machine in question is in "Incremental Motion" mode ``G91`` then
        the machine will only end up at ``x=10, y=10`` if it started at ``x=0, y=0``
        
        So, GCode interpretation is done via a virtual machine:
        
        ::
        
            >>> from pygcode import Machine, GCodeRapidMove
        
            >>> m = Machine()
            >>> m.pos
            <Position: X0 Y0 Z0>
            >>> g = GCodeRapidMove(X=10, Y=20)
            >>> m.process_gcodes(g)
            >>> m.pos
            <Position: X10 Y20 Z0>
            >>> m.process_gcodes(g)
            >>> m.pos
            <Position: X10 Y20 Z0>   # same position; machine in absolute mode
            >>> m.mode.distance
            <GCodeAbsoluteDistanceMode: G90>  # see
        
            >>> m.process_gcodes(GCodeIncrementalDistanceMode())
            >>> m.process_gcodes(g)  # same gcode as above
            >>> m.pos
            <Position: X20 Y40 Z0>
        
        all valid ``m.mode`` attributes can be found with ``from pygcode.gcodes import MODAL_GROUP_MAP; MODAL_GROUP_MAP.keys()``
        
        Also note that the order codes are interpreted is important.
        For example, the following code is WRONG
        
        ::
        
            from pygcode import Machine, Line
            m = Machine()
            line = Line('G0 x10 y10 G91')
            m.process_gcodes(*line.block.gcodes)  # WRONG!
        
        This will process the movement to ``x=10, y=10``, and **then** it will change the
        distance mode to *Incremental*... there are 2 ways to do this correctly.
        
        - ``m.process_gcodes(*sorted(line.block.gcodes))``, or simply
        - ``m.process_block(line.block)``
        
        sorting a list of gcodes will sort them in execution order (as specified by
        `LinuxCNC's order of execution <http://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/gcode/overview.html#_g_code_order_of_execution>`__).
        ``process_block`` does this automatically.
        
        If you need to process & change one type of gcode (usually a movement),
        you must split a list of gcodes into those executed before, and after the one
        in question.
        
        ::
        
            from pygcode import GCodeRapidMove, GCodeLinearMove
            from pygcode import Machine, Line, split_gcodes
            m = Machine()
            line = Line('M0 G0 x10 y10 G91')
            (befores, (g,), afters) = split_gcodes(line.block.gcodes, (GCodeRapidMove, GCodeLinearMove))
            m.process_gcodes(*sorted(befores))
            if g.X is not None:
                g.X += 100  # shift linear movements (rapid or otherwise)
            m.process_gcodes(g)
            m.process_gcodes(*sorted(afters))
        
        
        For a more practical use of machines & interpreting gcode, have a look at
        `pygcode-normalize.py <https://github.com/fragmuffin/pygcode/blob/master/scripts/pygcode-normalize.py>`__
        
        At the time of writing this, that script converts arcs to linear codes, and
        expands drilling cycles to basic movements (so my
        `GRBL <https://github.com/gnea/grbl>`__ machine can understand them)
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        This library came from my own needs to interpret and convert erroneous
        arcs to linear segments, and to expand canned drilling cycles, but also
        as a means to *learn* GCode.
        
        As such there is no direct plan for further development, however I'm
        interested in what you'd like to use it for, and cater for that.
        
        Generally, in terms of what to support, I'm following the lead of:
        
        - `GRBL <https://github.com/gnea/grbl>`__ and
        - `LinuxCNC <http://linuxcnc.org/>`__
        
        More support will come with increased interest.
        So that is... if you don't like what it does, or how it's documented, make some
        noise in the `issue section <https://github.com/fragmuffin/pygcode/issues>`__.
        if you get in early, you may get some free labour out of me ;)
        
        
        Supported G-Codes
        -----------------
        
        All GCodes supported by `LinuxCNC <http://linuxcnc.org>`__ can be written, and
        parsed by ``pygcode``.
        
        Few GCodes are accurately interpreted by a virtual CNC ``Machine`` instance.
        Supported movements are currently;
        
        - linear movements
        - arc movements
        - canned drilling cycles
